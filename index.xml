      <title>Cybercriminal decision-making</title>
      <link>https://numbersman77.netlify.com/teaching/cybercrime/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Existing theories assume that offenders make rational decisions, but these theories have rarely been tested experimentally. This project uses &amp;lsquo;honey accounts&amp;rsquo;, online accounts that have deliberately been rendered vulnerable to hacking, to allow an experimental investigation of cybercriminals&amp;rsquo; behavior. The research offers unique opportunities for conducting a stringent test of existing criminology theories on offenders&amp;rsquo; decision-making behavior. This study of offender behavior will broaden our understanding of cybercrime, as previous research has tended to focus on victims and security.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Risk Across the Urban Landscape</title>
      <link>https://numbersman77.netlify.com/teaching/risk-urban/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Parameters of Risk Across the Urban Landscape (PRAUL) uses data from multiple years on victimizations, crime risk factors, and victimization surveys to analyze these causal links between criminogeneity, fear of crime, and actual crime for the city of Amsterdam. Spatio-temporal clustering and regionalization procedures are used to identify areas of elevated risk and delineate analytical sub-regions that are as homogeneous as possible for the theoretical constructs of interest. These newly defined areas serve as units of analysis to study the interplay between the purported crime risk factors, crime, and the public’s reaction to crime and policing from a spatio-temporal perspective. The project aims to provide new insights into the relative importance of individual- and area-level causal factors of fear of crime.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Risky Business</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do businesses (e.g. bars or supermarkets) and facilities (e.g. libraries) generate or prevent crime? Urban planners and policy-makers often view businesses and facilities as a panacea to social problems: they create jobs and invest in their buildings and immediate surroundings. In contrast, and supported by most empirical research findings, environmental criminologists argue that crime is more likely to occur near businesses. However, such empirical research is based on cross-sectional data, which allows investigating correlation between businsses and crime. However, correlation does not imply causation. So, should urban planners combine residential and commercial buildings within neighborhoods? This project investigates the causal effect of businesses and facilities on crime using unique longitudinal data and recently developed econometric methods for spatio-temporal analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time for a crime</title>
      <link>https://numbersman77.netlify.com/teaching/time-for-crime/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do offenders commit crimes where and when they do? Improving on extant theory and empirical research in the geography of crime, the proposed PhD-research will investigate how offenders&amp;rsquo; time-specific knowledge of their environment acquired during their daily routines and the time-varying attractiveness of target areas affect offenders’ crime location choices. Combining police-register data on offenders and their offenses with unique data on the locations the offenders frequently visit and data on opening and closing hours of Dutch businesses and facilities, this cutting-edge research project not only advances scientific knowledge, but also contributes to better crime forecasting and urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>sppt: Spatial Point Pattern Test</title>
      <link>https://numbersman77.netlify.com/software/sppt/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://numbersman77.netlify.com/software/sppt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wsteenbeek/sppt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sppt&lt;/a&gt; is an R package that implements several Spatial Point Pattern Tests. The first version of the package started with Martin Andresen&amp;rsquo;s original &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfu.ca/~andresen/spptest/spptest.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spatial Point Pattern Test&lt;/a&gt;, but several other functions have been implemented since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tests in this package measure the degree of similarity at the local level between two spatial point patterns and is an area-based test. They are not used for the purpose of testing point patterns with the null hypotheses of random, uniform, or clustered distributions, but may be used to compare a particular point pattern with these distributions. One advantage of the tests is that they can be performed for a number of different area boundaries using the same original point datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply these tests if you are fundamentally interested in the similarity of two (or more) spatial point patterns for a specified areal unit. Do incidences of some form of cancer have a similar spatial pattern to the locations of known risk factors? Does crime have a similar spatial pattern as drinking establishments? Is the spatial pattern of exports similar to the spatial pattern of imports? Additionally, this spatial point pattern test can be used in longitudinal contexts as well: Is the spatial pattern of crime this year similar to the spatial pattern of crime last year, or ten years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install the package, follow the instructions on its &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wsteenbeek/sppt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
