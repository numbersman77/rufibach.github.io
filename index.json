We develop a binomial discrete choice model for criminal involvement and estimate it on individual data. We control for both the endogeneity that may be related to unobserved neighborhood characteristics and for sorting behavior. We find significant social interaction effects, but our findings do not imply multiple equilibria or large multiplier effects.\n","tags":null,"title":"Social interactions and crime revisited: An investigation using individual offender data in Dutch neighborhoods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fadoua Balabdaoui","Kaspar Rufibach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"47d7086cd3159e95d0eec40296563fa1","permalink":"https://www.kasparrufibach.ch/publication/stats_articles/2008-01-01_a_second_marshall_/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stats_articles/2008-01-01_a_second_marshall_/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A second {M}arshall inequality in convex estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samuel Muller","Kaspar Rufibach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"8c3108e1704b4903c23eaacd61136b33","permalink":"https://www.kasparrufibach.ch/publication/stats_articles/2008-01-01_on_the_max-domain_of/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stats_articles/2008-01-01_on_the_max-domain_of/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"On the max-domain of attraction of distributions with log-concave densities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaspar Rufibach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"7b044d2fb6962dd72a4ed42214e31c92","permalink":"https://www.kasparrufibach.ch/publication/stats_articles/2007-01-01_computing_maximum_li/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stats_articles/2007-01-01_computing_maximum_li/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Computing Maximum Likelihood Estimators of a Log-Concave Density Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaspar Rufibach","Manuel Bertschy","Manuela Schuettel","Michael Vock","Tina Wasserfallen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":978307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":978307200,"objectID":"d7e8b3ec50e7d4e4d229ac204f545d3e","permalink":"https://www.kasparrufibach.ch/publication/stats_articles/2001_01_01_evk/","publishdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stats_articles/2001_01_01_evk/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Eintrittsraten und Austrittswahrscheinlichkeiten EVK 2000","type":"publication"}]
