We define the extent to which different levels of geography are important in understanding the crime problem within cities and how those relationships change over time.\nMethods: Data are police recorded crime events for the period 2001–2009. More than 400,000 crime events are geocoded to about 15,000 street segments, nested within 114 neighborhoods, in turn nested within 44 districts. Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients are used to describe the crime concentration at the three spatial levels. Linear mixed models with random slopes of time are used to estimate the variance attributed to each level.\nResults: About 58–69 % of the variability of crime can be attributed to street segments, with most of the remaining variability at the district level. Our findings suggest that micro geographic units are key to understanding the crime problem and that the neighborhood does not add significantly beyond what is learned at the micro and macro levels. While the total number of crime events declines over time, the importance of street segments increases over time.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that micro geographic units are key to understanding the variability of crime within cities—despite the fact that they have received little criminological focus so far. Moreover, our results raise a strong challenge to recent focus on such meso geographic units as census block groups.\n","tags":null,"title":"Where the action is in crime?

It is less clear, however, whether collective efficacy in neighborhoods also enhances prosocial, other-regarding behavior. We studied this association by employing the Lost Letter Technique in a large-scale field experiment. Our data stem from 1,240 letters dropped in a representative sample of 110 Dutch neighborhoods, combined with neighborhood data based on a survey of residents (SSND2, n = 996) and information provided by Statistics Netherlands. We distinguish between two conditions: (1) location of the lost letter, that is, behind a car's windshield wiper or on the sidewalk; and (2) type of addressee, that is, a Dutch name or a Turkish/Moroccan name. When we decompose collective efficacy into social cohesion and shared expectations of social control, we find that shared control expectations clearly matter for the rate of posted letters. Social cohesion has no effect. Furthermore, a high percentage of non-Western residents, high residential mobility, and a relatively low local income level are negatively related to the rate of posted letters.\n","tags":null,"title":"Lost letters in Dutch neighborhoods: A field experiment on collective efficacy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John R.

En geven de totale zorgkosten per diabetespatiënt daadwerkelijk het beste inzicht in de prestaties van de zorggroep?\nOpzet: Dwarsdoorsnedeonderzoek met meerdere niveaus.\nMethode: Wij analyseerden de declaratiegegevens over 2009 van 104.544 diabetespatiënten die begeleid werden in een zorggroep. De gegevens waren afkomstig van Vektis. Per zorggroep bepaalden we de gemiddelde zorgkosten per patiënt voor alle curatieve zorg en voor diabetesspecifieke ziekenhuiszorg met de ‘simple mean’-methode en nogmaals met een geavanceerde ‘generalized linear mixed model’. Ook berekenden we welk deel van de gevonden verschillen konden worden toegeschreven aan de zorggroepen zelf.\nResultaten: De gemiddelde kosten voor de totale curatieve zorg per patiënt waren €3092-6546, zonder significante verschillen tussen zorggroepen. Met de generalized linear mixed-modelmethode was de variatie kleiner (€2884-3511) en waren er wel significante verschillen. Voor de kosten van diabetesspecifieke ziekenhuiszorg vonden we een soortgelijk resultaat, en ook de rangorde van de zorggroepen bleek afhankelijk van de gehanteerde methode. Het zorggroepeffect was gering, al was het bij de diabetesspecifieke ziekenhuiszorgkosten wel groter dan bij de totale curatieve zorgkosten (6,7% vs. 0,4%).\nConclusie: Bij het benchmarken van zorggroepen heeft de gebruikte methode invloed. Simpelweg de gemiddelde zorgkosten bepalen, wat nog vaak gebeurt, leidt tot een overschatting van de verschillen tussen zorggroepen; het generalized linear mixed model is nauwkeuriger en geeft een betere vergelijking. Het blijft echter zo dat totale zorgkosten een gebrekkige indicator zijn waar zorggroepen weinig invloed op hebben. De kosten van diabetesspecifieke ziekenhuiszorg zijn een betere indicator voor het vergelijken van zorggroepen, aangezien zorggroepen daar meer invloed op hebben.\n","tags":null,"title":"Verschillen zorgkosten tussen zorggroepen?

Spatially constrained hierarchical agglomerative clustering is used to aggregate individual observation locations to form homogeneous areas. Davies–Bouldin index and intraclass correlation coefficient are used to objectively identify the optimum number of clusters.\nResults: The newly identified areas differ from administrative neighborhoods as well as hot spots of disorder. The regionalization method provides a tentative solution to both the “zonation” and “aggregation” problems of the modifiable areal unit problem liable to affect empirical studies of BWT.\nConclusions: Hot spot analysis fails to identify areas with moderate levels of disorder, which impedes testing the basic precept of BWT.

As neighbourhood business owners have both individual and professional local stakes, they may take responsibility for a place and its immediate surroundings. Using a dataset of 895 residents and 385 entrepreneurs nested within 161 residential neighbourhoods, we show that local business owners are more willing to intervene in disorderly situations than unemployed residents. The findings suggest that this is caused by them having both higher expectations about intervention by others and greater belief in their own problem-solving capabilities. We speculate that although entrepreneurs only report higher willingness than unemployed residents but not employed residents, their presence may nevertheless influence neighbourhood order because they spend much time locally and thus have many opportunities to turn their willingness into action on behalf of the neighbourhood.\n","tags":null,"title":"The willingness to intervene in problematic neighbourhood situations: A comparison of local entrepreneurs and (un-)employed residents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fredrica Nyqvist","Mikael Nygård","Wouter Steenbeek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1374969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1374969600,"objectID":"ed88f1c8f4c0fbcdef35b9eab0229a51","permalink":"https://www.kasparrufibach.ch/publication/stats_articles/2013-article-social-capital-health/","publishdate":"2013-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stats_articles/2013-article-social-capital-health/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Social capital can be conceptualised as an individual resource residing in relationships between individuals or as a collective resource produced through interactions in neighbourhoods, communities or societies. Previous studies suggest that social capital is, in general, good for health. However, there is a shortage of studies analysing the association between individual and collective social capital in relation to health amongst older people.\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between municipal- and individual-level social capital and self-rated health amongst older people in Western Finland and Northern Sweden.\nMethod: Data were retrieved from a cross-sectional postal questionnaire survey conducted in 2010. The study included, in total, 6,838 people aged 65, 70, 75 and 80 years living in the two Bothnia regions, Västerbotten, Sweden and Pohjanmaa, Finland. The association between social capital and self-rated health was tested through multi-level logistic regression analyses with ecometric tests. Social capital was measured by two survey items: interpersonal trust and social participation.\nResults: Individual-level social capital including social participation and trust was significantly associated with self-rated health. A negative association was found between municipal-level trust and health. However, almost all variation in self-rated health resided on the individual level.\nConclusions: We conclude that contextual-level social capital on a municipal level is less important for understanding the influence of social capital on health in the Bothnia region of Finland and Sweden. On the other hand, our study shows that individual-level social participation and trust have a positive and significant association with self-rated health. We suggest that other ways of defining social capital at the collective level, such as the inclusion of neighbourhood social capital, could be one direction for future research.\n","tags":null,"title":"Social capital and self-rated health amongst older people in western Finland and northern Sweden: A multi-level analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Kreis","Wouter Steenbeek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1374969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1374969600,"objectID":"68f3ac51e0aedb804c82a6400f31b083","permalink":"https://www.kasparrufibach.ch/publication/stats_articles/2013-chapter-space-time-police/","publishdate":"2013-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stats_articles/2013-chapter-space-time-police/","section":"publication","summary":"\n","tags":null,"title":"Space-time visualization and analysis of public attitudes towards crime and policing in the Netherlands, 1993-2001","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wouter Steenbeek","Beate G.M.
