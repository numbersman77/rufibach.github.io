      <description>I am regularly teaching to statisticians and non-statisticians about various biostatistical topics. Slides are available for download for some of the courses.
At Roche, I am responsible for the technical training planning of about 200 biostatistics staff. I coordinate a major chunk of the biostatistics courses for non-statistics functions. A full-day introductory biostatistics course that I have given together with Marcel Wolbers has been selected as part of the official training program for all Roche affiliates globally.</description>
